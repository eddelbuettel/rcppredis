  This note show how to use Redis cache (near-)real-time market data, and
  utilise its publish/subscribe ("pub/sub") facility to distribute the data.

# Overview

[Redis][redis] \citep{Redis} is a very popular, very powerful, and very
widely-used 'in-memory database-structure store' or server.  We provide a brief
introduction to it in a sibbling vignette.

This note describes an interesting use case and illustrates both the ability
of \Redis to act as a (short-term) data cache (for which [Redis][redis] is
very frequently used) but also rely on its ability to act as "pub/sub"
message broker. The "pub/sub" (short for "publish/subscribe") framework is
common to distribute data in a context where (possibly a large number of)
"subscribers" consume data provided by one or a few services, often on a
local network.  Entire libraries and application frameworks such as
[ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) (and literally hundreds more) have pub/sub at
its core. But as this note shows, one may not need anything apart from a
(possibly already existing) [Redis][redis] client.

# Use Case: Market Data

## Basics

Monitoring financial market data is a very common application. In package
\pkg{dang} we provide a function `intradayMarketMonitor()` (based on and
extending an earlier version by Josh Ulrich publish in [this
gist](https://gist.github.com/joshuaulrich/ee11ef67b1461df399b84efd3c8f9f67#file-intraday-sp500-r))
which does just that for the SP500 index and its symbol ^GSPC (at Yahoo!
Finance). For non-tradeable index symbols such as ^GSPC one can retrieve
near-"real-time" updates which is nice. We put "real-time" in quotes here as
there are of course delays in the transmission from the exchange or index
provide to a service such as Yahoo! and then down a retail broadband line to
a consumer. Yet it is "close" to real-time---as opposed to explicitly delayed
data that we cover below. So `intradayMarketMonitor()` runs in an endless
loop, updates the symbol and plot, and after market close once writes its
history into an RDS file so that a restart can access some history. It is
nicely minimal and self-contained design.


\begin{figure}

    \caption{Intray Market Monitoring Example}
    \label{fig:intraday-market-monitoring}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:intraday-market-monitoring} shows plot resulting from calling
the function on a symbol, here again ^GSPC, when two days of history have
been accumulated. (The plot was generated on a weekend with the preceding
Friday close providing the last data point.)

## Possible Shortcomings

Some of the short-comings of the approach in `intradayMarketMonitor()` are

- use of one R process per symbol
- same process used for monitoring and plotting
- no persistence until end of day

Moreover, the 'real-time' symbol for the main market index is available only
during (New York Stock Exchange) market hours.  Yet sometimes one wants to
gauge a market reaction or 'mood' at off-market hours.

So with this, idea arose to decouple market data _acquisition and caching_
from actual _visualization_ or other monitoring.  This would also permit
distributing the tasks over several machines: for example an 'always-on'
monitoring machine could always track the data and store it for other
'on-demand' machines or applications to access it.  And as we have seen,
[Redis][redis] makes for a fine data 'caching' mechanism.
