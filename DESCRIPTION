Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings for 'Redis' using the 'hiredis' Library
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2023-08-19
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel and Bryan W. Lewis
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: Connection to the 'Redis' key/value store using the
 C-language client library 'hiredis' (included as a fallback) with
 'MsgPack' encoding provided via 'RcppMsgPack' headers. It now also
 includes the pub/sub functions from the 'rredis' package.
SystemRequirements: An available hiredis library (eg via package
 libhiredis-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, hiredis-devel on Fedora/RedHat, or
 directly from source from <https://github.com/redis/hiredis>) can be
 used but version 1.0.2 is also included and built on demand if needed.
 The optional 'rredis' package can be installed from the 'ghrr' 'drat'
 repo for additional illustrations and tests.
